                Healthy communities: <br />
                <br />
                We believe when our communities are healthy and Eco-friendly,
                people thrive. Consequently, often many of the services that
                keep people healthy are difficult to access for the people who
                need them most. We will facilitate enabling environments to
                promote creativity, innovation and collaboration for healthcare
                causes and objectives. We will ensure that through our community
                networks every Hungry Citizen within our reach gets Food
                Assistance and the Homeless get a clean living environment with
                access to disease prevention medicine.

                We believe that cities and regions are stronger when their
                residents have opportunities to thrive as entrepreneurs,
                employers, and employees. The Kindle Gate Foundation will
                partner with private and public organizations, using technology
                to provide indigents citizens and job seekers with necessary
                skills acquisitions and connect employers to trained potential
                employees. This will help remove employment barriers by
                modernizing the workforce system. Through advocacy and
                evidence-based research we will act as a guide for policymakers
                across African governments in order to promote thought based
                leadership and entrepreneurship.

                    We believe that by the articulation of a common position
                    towards deploying our diverse and rich cultural resources,
                    we would contribute to combating vices such as youth
                    restiveness, insecurity and unemployment. These efforts will
                    be manifested by promoting activities, events and curating
                    Exhibitions, Workshops, Training and Festivals of African
                    Inspired Arts, Drama, Music, Crafts and Culture. Also,
                    entrepreneurs will be empowered through capacity
                    development, seed capital, mentoring and networking.
